                        <h2>Why give a testimonial?</h2>

                        <p>Even after our spectacular effort, some people are still skeptical regarding what we can do
                            for them. If you give us a stellar review about the experience you had with us, it will help
                            those people to make a decision about us.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>Few things you can consider to put in your testimonial:</h2>

                        <ol>
                            <li>How did FindMentor help you?</li>
                            <li>How was your life before FindMentor?</li>
                            <li>How did your life improve after joining FindMentor?</li>

                            <li>If you were to compare FindMentor&nbsp;to one of the person/things in your life, what
                                would it be?</li>
                        </ol>
