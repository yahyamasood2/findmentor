                        <p>You can earn coins by sharing your&nbsp;referral link with others. Many teachers get
                            hundreds&nbsp;(even thousands) of free coins every month by using their referral link.</p>

                        <h2>What is my referral link?</h2>

                        <p>You can <a href="./refer-and-earn">get your referral link here</a>.</p>

                        <h2>How many coins do I get for each referral?</h2>

                        <p>Coins for a referral vary by country of the person you refer. You can <a
                                href="./refer-and-earn">check the complete country-coin&nbsp;list
                                here</a>.</p>

                        <h2>What if someone I refer&nbsp;buys coins?</h2>

                        <p>You will get 10% of&nbsp;the coins they buy as well.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>I referred someone and didn't get coins. Why?</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>If someone joins as a student, we don't give any joining bonus for that. You will get
                                10% of the coins they buy.</li>
                            <li>For tutors, referral bonus is given only after they complete profile.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Where should I put my referral link?</h2>

                        <p>We have seen excellent work by people who refer us on Facebook. Facebook is great if you want
                            to share with a lot of people. Posting in relevant Facebook groups can be really effective.
                        </p>

                        <p>You can also share your referral links in blogs, forums, email footers and teaching
                            communities as well.&nbsp;</p>
