                        <p>Once you&nbsp;post your
                            requirements,&nbsp;relevant teachers will contact&nbsp;you.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>You can also <a target="_blank" href="./find-tutor">search for teachers</a> and contact them
                            on
                            your own.</p>

                        <h2>How much does it cost me when a teacher contacts me?</h2>

                        <p>Nothing. If a teacher contacts you, it's free for you.</p>

                        <h2>How many teachers can I contact?</h2>

                        <p>To get you started, we give you 150&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="./coins">coins</a>&nbsp;to
                            contact 3 teachers.</p>

                        <p>After that, you can wait for teachers to contact you which is free for you.</p>

                        <p>If you wish to contact more teachers, you can also buy coins.</p>

                        <h2>What happens when I am in touch with a tutor?</h2>

                        <p>You and the teacher decide the terms, the work to be done, remuneration and the payment
                            method. We are not involved in that.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>What kind of quality can I expect from teachers?</h2>

                        <p>We deliberately make it hard to be a teacher at our website. Due to this, only 54% of
                            teachers are able to complete the application process. We also remove and disable many
                            teachers because of various reasons. Teachers also have to pay a small amount to contact
                            you. This leads to a spam free experience where only genuine teachers apply.</p>

                        <p>Having said that, we don't personally verify everyone's teaching ability. Therefore, you will
                            find all kinds of teachers on the website. With some effort, you can find great teachers.
