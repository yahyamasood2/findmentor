                        <p>Your feedback is very important to us. In fact it's so important, that we pay you for the
                            feedback. How many coins we pay depends on the quality of the problem/feature you contact us
                            for.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Our features are mostly guided by your feedback. It takes time to do things right, but we do
                            get them right, eventually.</p>

                        <p>We have given 1000s of coins for the bugs which you reported. We can't share the bugs as
                            there are a lot of those. However, following are some of the features we developed in
                            response to user feedback.</p>
