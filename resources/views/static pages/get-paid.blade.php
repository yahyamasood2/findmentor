                        <p>Now, you can get payments&nbsp;from students anywhere in the world via FindMentor.</p>

                        <h2>Why did we develop this feature?</h2>

                        <p>We get frequent emails from teachers who gave their services, but students didn't pay
                            them.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Also, many genuine students don't want to pay in&nbsp;advance because they are afraid of
                            losing money. Many of these students have already lost money to unreliable service
                            providers.</p>

                        <p>We built this system to prevent fraud and make it easy for&nbsp;teachers and students to
                            trust each other.</p>

                        <h2>How does it work?</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The student deposits the money by using the "Pay" button on your profile page.</li>
                            <li>We keep the payment (on hold)&nbsp;with us.</li>
                            <li>You deliver the service.</li>
                            <li>The payment is released to you.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Why get payment via FindMentor?</h2>

                        <p>Getting payments via us has the following advantages. You can:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Secure payment before service - prevent fraud - stop losing money.</li>
                            <li>Get advanced payments from students who are hesitant&nbsp;to pay in advance.</li>
                            <li>Get payment from international students.</li>
                            <li>Give students the option to pay by card.</li>
                            <li>Accept payment in 91 currencies. We will convert the money to your currency and
                                deposit&nbsp;to your account.</li>
                            <li>Get reviews with "verified label." - Once a student pays you via us, we know with a fair
                                degree of certainty that the review is genuine. We label reviews by these students as
                                "Verified," which generates extra trust in the students' that visit your profile.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>In the future, we will also use reviews to determine tutor rankings and suggestions to
                            students.</p>

                        <h2>Which payment mode can I use to receive payments?</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bank account</strong>&nbsp;(15% fee) -&nbsp;We can currently send payments to
                                bank accounts in Australia, Canada, India, and the USA.</li>
                            <li><strong>PayPal</strong> (15% fee) - PayPal helps us to send money to over 200
                                countries.&nbsp;When we send you a PayPal payment, we pay the fee so you get the
                                full amount we send. You don't pay the usual 4% fee to PayPal for receiving payments.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>FindMentor Coins</strong> (10% fee) - For everybody else, you can get paid in
                                FindMentor coins.</li>
