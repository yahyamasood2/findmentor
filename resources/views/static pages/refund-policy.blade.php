                        <p>This refund policy applies if you are dealing directly with FindMentor&nbsp;staff. If you are
                            dealing with students and teachers listed on the website, please see the&nbsp;<a
                                target="_blank" href="./terms-and-conditions">terms and conditions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>Coin Purchase</h2>

                        <p>No refund is given on purchased&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="./coins">coins</a>.</p>

                        <div><strong>Money deducted but didn't get coins?</strong></div>

                        <p>If the money was deducted but you didn't get coins, you will get a refund automatically from
                            your bank within a maximum of 14 days - it usually happens much faster in most cases. If we
                            do get the money (usually happens within a day), we will credit coins in your account and
                            send you a confirmation email when that happens.</p>

                        <h2>When teachers contact a student</h2>

                        <p>If a teacher contacts a student whose phone isn't&nbsp;verified, and the student doesn't read
                            the message within 15 days, we refund coins for that. We also give refunds if
                            teachers&nbsp;spend coins on fake/spam/scam&nbsp;jobs automatically.</p>

                        <h2>When student contact teachers</h2>

                        <p>Coins used to contact a tutor, free or paid, are not refunded if you are unable to reach the
                            tutor for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>For student payments to tutors outside of FindMentor.com</h2>

                        <p>If any payment is made outside our website, we can't do anything about it. You may still
                            contact us and we will try to help but we can't guarantee that we will be able to get your
                            refund. Please see <a href="#refundFromTutorsThroughUs">how refunds work when you pay via
