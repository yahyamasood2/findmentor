So those teachers won&#39;t be able to get reviews at all.</li>\r\n	<li>Not all students can pay online.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why are we making this change?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since anybody could review, tutors got many fake reviews - negative reviews from the competitors and positive reviews from friends or fake accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This problem started small - with a few fake reviews a week. Within a year, it became a full-blown epidemic with hundreds of fake reviews a day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What really broke my heart while investigating these fake reviews is that it wasn&#39;t just some bad apples who were doing these things. Many genuine teachers who have a history of doing good work were also involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>$5 reviews</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The &quot;Payment Verified&quot; label in a review helps gives it credibility. To get that, some teachers just got the minimum amount ($5 or equivalent). Some of these payments/reviews were fake.&nbsp;But there is no way to be sure, so all of these reviews remained public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So...&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will do what we usually do when unsure about how to handle ambiguous data - we make the data transparent - for everybody to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We will start displaying the total amount that a tutor received with their review,</strong>&nbsp;thus allowing new students to judge whether&nbsp;all those minimum payment reviews are genuine (or not).</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Advantages of the new system</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to saving us from massive headaches, these changes have the following advantages for teachers:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>This will&nbsp;eliminate fake reviews.</li>\r\n	<li>Teachers who have positive reviews get more students, and teachers with the &quot;Payment verified&quot; label even more so.<br />\r\n	<strong>The positive impact of&nbsp;showing the total payment from students&nbsp;will be even more pronounced for genuine teachers.</strong></li>\r\n	<li>Increased transparency and trust among students will bring in more students through referrals, growing business for all teachers.</li>\r\n	<li>Reviews due to petty disputes and disagreements will cease altogether.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problems with the new system</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Some&nbsp;students won&#39;t&nbsp;be able to give genuine reviews.</li>\r\n	<li>Many existing genuine positive reviews will be hidden.</li>\r\n	<li>Many genuine negative reviews will be removed, which may result in a bad experience for students.</li>\r\n	<li>Not all teachers will be comfortable sharing the payment data with the world for privacy reasons. If you are one of those teachers, please ask your students to remove the reviews.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just those problems that we know. If we haven&#39;t considered anything, please contact us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why we are still making this change despite all these problems</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantages of the new system outweigh any issues that come with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though this change means fewer reviews, the reviews that we will have will be genuine and transparent - thus more trustable.</p>', '2021-07-02 01:52:17', '2021-07-07 03:47:13', NULL),

(3, 1, 'Online Teaching Guide', NULL, '<h1>How to teach online - Comprehensive guide for teachers</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>I receive many queries regarding online teaching often asking&nbsp;questions similar to what I already answered hundreds of times. To help more people without having to repeat, I compiled all the questions and some more to make a comprehensive guide to online teaching which I hope will help many teachers who are new or unaware of this. This guide is not an end in itself but is an excellent starting point. If you are an experienced online teacher and have any feedback or additions, please feel free to contact/comment for the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is online teaching?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>For the purpose of this guide, Online teaching is the practice of teaching to an individual or a group online. Basically, it&#39;s live-real time-instruction where teacher and student(s) are in different locations. What that means is that you can teach anyone anywhere from the comfort of your home.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has never been a better time to teach online. Awareness of online learning options is increasing every day. As more people join&nbsp;the internet&nbsp;with&nbsp;ever-improving&nbsp;internet connections,&nbsp;there&nbsp;is no end to where this opportunity would stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who can teach online?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To be an online teacher, you need the following minimum:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>You should have or be willing to learn&nbsp;basic computer skills.</li>\r\n	<li>A good internet connection and a computer/laptop</li>\r\n	<li>Command of the subject you are going to teach.</li>\r\n	<li>Digital pen (optional, discussed below)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>How much can I earn?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>That question makes sense when someone is employing you. If a company is hiring you directly, you should ask them. If however, you work independently, then it works the same way as it worked before the internet:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You charge as much as you want.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers registered in findmentor.com&nbsp;charge from less than $1 to over $100 per hour. Everyone charges based on their skills, living standard, the country they are in, existing clientele, and the demand for their particular skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are not sure what to charge, start from the minimum, and increase gradually with experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What are the timings?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Unless you are employed by a company, you can decide the timing yourself. Since online teaching is global and different individuals have different preferences, you should talk to the students and come to an agreement regarding the time that suits you and the student. I know teachers who go on a trip&nbsp;and take their laptop with them, enjoy during the day and teach from their hotel room at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Typing prowess</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Given that most of us will spend a big chunk of our lives typing, it makes sense to learn to type fast. The need becomes even more urgent if you want to teach online. The proper way to type is to touch type i.e. typing without looking at the keyboard.&nbsp;It took me about one month, one hour per day, to learn to type at pro speeds. I used typing master software. Now you can use typing software like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.typingbolt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Typingbolt</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to teach online?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are various tools available to teach online, free, and paid. If you don&#39;t want to spend money initially, you can just use the free tools as they work almost as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Skype</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Skype is my favorite go-to tool. Why?<br />\r\nIt&#39;s free,&nbsp;has millions of users, has screen sharing and video calling in addition to audio calls. Its sound quality is better than most other services, free or paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some tips to use Skype&nbsp;in addition to the usual calling features which will help you in the session:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Skype test call or Echo/Sound&nbsp;</strong><strong>Test</strong><strong>&nbsp;service:</strong>&nbsp;This is the default contact in your Skype. At times when you call someone, you can&#39;t hear them or they can&#39;t hear you. The problem can be in the audio of either. It&#39;s easier to test with Skype test call. It takes less than a minute and tells whose system is at fault.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Share screen:</strong>&nbsp;In case you want to show the student something on your screen or see what they are doing on theirs, this feature is located in the toolbar of the ongoing call.<br />\r\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blogassets2.teacheron.com/skype-screen-share.png\" style=\"height:407px; width:629px\" /><br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	What you should know is that even though your screen is shared, the viewer can&#39;t do anything on your screen. They can just watch your screen like a movie. To enable others to do stuff on your computer we can use TeamViewer which I will discussed later.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Send files:&nbsp;</strong>You can send files by using the option in the chat menu or by simply dragging the file in the chat window.<br />\r\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blogassets2.teacheron.com/skype-send-files.png\" style=\"height:125px; width:629px\" /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>TeamViewer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am in love with this software. It&#39;s easy to install and convenient to use. If you use skype screen sharing, you might notice that at times the video hangs while the audio is still working. For a reliable screen sharing experience, I use Teamviewer. Teamviewer also allows you to give control to the other party so they can work on your system. This feature comes in handy for things that can&#39;t be done on a whiteboard, for example, if you are showing someone how to work on PowerPoint or teaching web development, you will need screen sharing with control.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Online whiteboards</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Online whiteboards are just like the blackboards and whiteboards we use in a physical classroom. They also have some additional features like the ability to upload documents, write/copy/paste text, etc. I am listing two of my current favorites. If these do not exist in the future, you can easily google &quot;Online whiteboard&quot; and you will see many options. Once you are on the board, you get a unique link that you&nbsp;give to your student&nbsp;so both of you are on the same board. This allows you to see what the student is doing and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://awwapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AwwApp</a>: It&#39;s free, easy to use, requires no registration. Simply go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://awwapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">awwapp.com</a>&nbsp;and click on Start drawing and you are good to go. You will notice various options in the sidebar which you should explore.&nbsp;<br />\r\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blogassets2.teacheron.com/pencil-size_0.png\" style=\"height:267px; width:629px\" /><br />\r\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blogassets2.teacheron.com/drawing-options.png\" style=\"height:327px; width:629px\" /><br />\r\n	<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://blogassets2.teacheron.com/share-link-to-board.png\" style=\"height:276px; width:629px\" /></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://idroo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Idroo</a>: Idroo is more artistic and is more functional than Awwapp but it requires you to log in. One of the main reasons I like Idroo is that you can see the other person&#39;s mouse pointer as it moves on the Idroo page. This helps to point at things on the board easily and ensures that teacher and student are looking at the same thing.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h3>Digital pen</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing on a whiteboard is painfully slow and difficult if you are using a mouse or touchpad. In order to make the writing on the whiteboard easy and fast, we use digital pens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following is a video on how to use a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2s3vN9Y\" target=\"_blank\">Vacom</a><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2s3vN9Y\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;digital pen</a>. Given that all digital pens work the same way, you can buy a cheaper iBall digital pen. If you are not comfortable shopping online, you can get a digital pen from a local shop which sells computer accessories.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to teach any of the usual academic subjects online and you want to do it properly, you must have a digital pen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Do you need a webcam?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It depends on the student&#39;s requirement. From my experience, most adult students prefer not to have a webcam. However, most parents of kids want a webcam to keep the child engaged.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So here&#39;s what you should do. Keep a webcam. It&#39;s cheap. When you get a student, just ask them if they would like to see you and go accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to collect payment for online work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Following are some of my&nbsp;favorite options:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>FindMentor</strong>: Students don&#39;t like to pay in advance due to trust issues. When paying by <strong>FindMentor</strong>, we hold their funds and release payment to you after a month - which is enough time for them to experience your service. This is good for teachers as well because&nbsp;the payment is assured for them after delivering the service. We launched this service after receiving multiple complaints from both students (paying and not getting the service) and teachers (doing the work and not getting paid). Being paid via <strong>FindMentor&nbsp;</strong>also allows you to get reviews on your profile which helps you to get more business. There is a 15% commission on receiving payments through us but it&#39;s better than not getting anything after giving your services.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Directly in the bank</strong>: This should be your default for receiving payments if the student is in the same country as you are or they can make payment in the bank. There is no fee to you when they transfer money. You get the money almost instantaneously. Therefore, it&#39;s the best option&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"https://transferwise.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lfj5X\" target=\"_blank\">Transferwise</a>: Transferwise is a relatively new service from the same people who made Skype. I use them for receiving international payments. Their service is exceptional. They also have the lowest fee as compared to any other money exchange service in the world. They are even cheaper than Western Union which at times claims to send money for no fee but takes a hefty cut in the exchange rate itself which most people don&#39;t realize.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://paypal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PayPal</a>: It&#39;s the most convenient of all but that comes at a price. They take almost 5% commission upfront and if there is a conversion, you should be ready to pay an extra 3-5% on the currency exchange which is a lot. It&#39;s a decent racket but I use them from time to time because of the convenience and the trust many people place in them.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://westernunion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Western Union</a>: You can get money in cash, below a certain limit, with fewer reporting requirements.&nbsp;It can be expensive, therefore you should prefer Transferwise., be</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Should I give free demo sessions?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are at a stage where you have this question, you should give demo sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is always a risk that the student&nbsp;won&#39;t convert after the demo. Risking an hour of your time is something you learn to be comfortable with.&nbsp;Some students may take advantage of demo classes, but, if you are good, you will see that giving a free demo is an excellent way of converting students into paying clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I taught as an online teacher, the following strategy worked for me:<br />\r\nI asked the students to pay for the demo hour only if they liked the session. That meant that they didn&#39;t pay for the demo if they didn&#39;t want to continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tools for accounts and finance tutors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with mind-boggling numbers, finance and accounts teachers have to deal with tables and never-ending columns of data. Solving all this data manually over the whiteboard can be a real pain. Thankfully, Google has a free answer to all your troubles. Even though many people are aware of Google Drive, they aren&rsquo;t using it the way they that would make their life easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this is how we do it - login to your Google account, go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://drive.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Drive</a>, click on Create, and then select spreadsheet. A new spreadsheet should open up. You can share this with the student. What&rsquo;s great about this is that you can use the power of Excel in real-time. Both you and the student can edit the spreadsheet at the same time. Standard Excel calculations and formulas are also available thus making it really close to using Microsoft Excel or other open-source Excel tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greatest benefit is that all the history gets saved so you can see the thought process of your students. Also, you can see what the other person is doing as Google highlights the cell which the other user(s) has selected or is editing. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to find students to teach online?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no easy answer to this. If there was, everybody would leave their jobs and teach online according to their comfort. However, there are some steps you can take to increase your chances of getting students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Make a great Profile</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people who register at <strong>findmentor</strong>.com or in any website for that matter try to go through making their profile as quickly as possible. Some even put junk text if there is a minimum they are forced to write.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a big mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students don&#39;t know you and they don&#39;t know how good you are. The only point of reference they have about you is your profile. To put it simply, If you make a bad profile, you will get bad (no) results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should spend at least as much time in preparing your online profile as you spend on writing a well-written resume as it can have the same impact on your life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Profile picture:</strong>&nbsp;Your profile picture should consist of a clear headshot in which you are smiling. Teaching is not dating but when students are looking at a stranger that they can trust, the same subconscious kicks in. Do not put a random image of a God or a puppy, it would be a waste of time and space.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Share</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People who succeed have certain traits. They think long term, love what they do, and like to share. One of the best things that you can do to succeed is to help others succeed. Forums are a great starting point for sharing. Find a forum where lots of students and tutors come, and&nbsp;help the students there, thereby building authority. You will gain respect as an expert and will get paid assignments over time. This is not an overnight kill. It requires patience and a genuine willingness to help. But results can be stellar depending on your niche and expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you like the post and think it can be helpful to others, please let us know in the comments and share it using your preferred services below.&nbsp;This may as well be the start of your sharing mindset.&nbsp;You will not only help your friends, but you will also help&nbsp;yourself and me as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please mention in the comments if you have any questions.

If they see photo of a religious figure, cartoon, scenery etc, they feel as if you are trying to evade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, according to our data, profiles with an image with the face clearly visible get contacted at least twice as much as people who have bad photo or no photo at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Write a clear and detailed profile description</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Treat how you make your profile like a waste of time, that&#39;s what it will be. Treat it like an investment, and you will get stellar results.&nbsp;If one can&#39;t commit to writing a clear and detailed profile for oneself, which will be viewed by thousands of students, same lazy attitude will be evident in their teaching as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your profile description is the most important deciding factor if students and parents will hire you or not. Ironically, most people want to spend as little time as possible on this section. In findmentor.com, we have a minimum limit of 100 words on the description. This is so that people get engaged enough and they know you enough to contact you. Here are some clear do&#39;s and donts for profile description:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dos:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Write about your experience.</li>\r\n	<li>Write about the positive results your students got.</li>\r\n	<li>Write about your education and schooling, especially if from a prominent institution.</li>\r\n	<li>Write about your teaching style, methodology.</li>\r\n	<li>Use proper punctuations, and capitalization. Use grammarly / microsoft word if you have to.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Donts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Do not make spelling mistakes.</li>\r\n	<li>Do not use all capital letters. It not only looks bad and is harder to read, it&#39;s considered as bad manners on the web.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Do not write SMS language. It&#39;s unprofessional and casual. You won&#39;t write in SMS language in your resume. Don&#39;t write here as well.</li>\r\n	<li>Do not copy/paste your resume.</li>\r\n	<li>Do not put junk characters just to complete the word count.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li>Do not put random quotes or philosophy. I have seen some teachers use this really intelligently but in 95% cases, it&#39;s wrongly used. Unless you know exactly what you are doing, it&#39;s better to avoid using quotations altogether.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Customize your application and be sincere</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you apply to jobs, the first response should convey to the student that you have read their requirements carefully and are responding to them based on that. It shouldn&#39;t look as if you are just using a template response.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reply promptly to student queries</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Put a notification for emails so when you get notification from us, you can promptly apply to jobs and reply to the students. Earlier you contact a student, better is the chance of conversion.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Get premium membership</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.findmentor.com/premium-membership-for-tutors\" target=\"_blank\">Premium membership</a>&nbsp;helps you to be at the top of the list when students search for subjects you teach at your location or online.

You can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Secure payment before service - prevent fraud - stop losing money.</li>\r\n	<li>Get advanced payments from students who are hesitant&nbsp;to pay in advance.</li>\r\n	<li>Get payment from foreign students.</li>\r\n	<li>Give students the option to pay by card - in 91 currencies. We will convert the money to your currency and deposit&nbsp;to your account.</li>\r\n	<li>Get reviews with &quot;verified label.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Secure your payment (and secure advance from hesitant students)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We get frequent emails from teachers who delivered tutoring services but students didn&#39;t pay them. The idea for our escrow system was a direct result of these requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, many genuine students don&#39;t want to pay in&nbsp;advance because:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>They are afraid of losing money or</li>\r\n	<li>Someone has defrauded them before you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting paid via us solves these problems and secures both of you. This is how:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The student pays you by going to your profile.</li>\r\n	<li>We keep the payment (on hold)&nbsp;with us.</li>\r\n	<li>You deliver the service.</li>\r\n	<li>Payment is released to you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to say to students who are not willing to pay in advance?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can say to the student something like:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Please go to my profile and click on the Pay&nbsp;button. There, you can schedule the payment to release later. Payment won&#39;t be released to me until you are satisfied and release the payment yourself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get payments from foreign students</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting payments from international students is a challenge for many teachers. This is true, especially for small amounts, which can be very expensive to get.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International students prefer to pay by card. We have designed our system to&nbsp;make them easier to pay by card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You can accept payments in 91 currencies.&nbsp;</strong>We will convert the money to your currency and deposit&nbsp;to your account.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get &quot;verified&quot; reviews</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a student pays you via us, we know with a fair degree of certainty that the review is genuine. Reviews by a student that has paid you are labeled as &quot;Verified&quot; which generates extra trust in the students&#39; minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the future, we will also use reviews to determine tutor rankings and suggestions to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to get payment via FindMentor?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once logged in as a tutor, you can go to Menu &gt; Wallet &gt;&nbsp;Accounts (Getting paid)&nbsp;and add your bank account details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students can go to your profile link and click on the &quot;Pay&quot; button to pay you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Is there any fee for this service?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes.
